## Bank Marketing Dataset Analysis – Summary of Findings
### 1. Data Overview
The dataset contains marketing campaign data from a Portuguese bank.

No missing values were found, and data types were appropriately structured.

Key attributes include client demographics, contact information, and campaign response (y).

### 2. Statistical Insights
Mean age of clients is in the early 30s.

Account balances vary widely, with some clients having negative balances, indicating debt or overdrafts.

Clients with a tertiary education level tend to have the highest average account balances, while those with only primary education have lower balances on average.

### 3. Visual Insights
a. Line Chart – Call Duration Over Days
There's no consistent trend in call duration across the days, but a few days have spikes suggesting focused campaign efforts.

b. Bar Chart – Average Balance by Education
Clients with higher education tend to maintain higher average account balances.

Financial literacy or income level could play a role here.

c. Histogram – Age Distribution
Most clients fall in the 28–40 age range.

This age group may represent the bank’s primary marketing demographic.

d. Scatter Plot – Balance vs Duration
There's a mild positive trend between higher balance and longer call durations.

Clients who subscribed to the term deposit (y = yes) tend to have either longer calls or higher balances, suggesting more engaging conversations may lead to conversions.

## Key Takeaways
i. Education level appears to correlate with financial standing.

ii. Longer calls may contribute to successful conversions.

iii. The dataset is clean and ready for further predictive modeling or segmentation analysis.
